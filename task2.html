 <h2>Skills</h2>
 <ul>
 <li><p5><b>Communication and interpersonal skills:</b> Communication skills
are generally seen as a subset of interpersonal skills, as are decision-making and
problem-solving, but both are important enough to consider in their own right too.
 This is such a huge area that you may find that it is worth taking our
Interpersonal Skills Self-Assessment Test to find out how good your listening and
other interpersonal skills are.
 Communication and other interpersonal skills cover a huge range of skills,
including:
 Effective listening skills, together with techniques such as clarification
and reflection, can help prevent misunderstanding.
 Verbal and non-verbal communication, include both how to use your voice and
choose the right words, and also the use of tone of voice, body language and how
you dress. They can help to build rapport.
 Unfortunately, there are also many barriers to effective communication in
any communication situation. These can lead to misunderstanding or even
conflict.</p5></li>
 <br>

 <li><p5><b>Thinking skills:</b>Creative thinking and critical thinking. This
describes the ability to think in different and unusual ways about problems, and
find new solutions, or generate new ideas, coupled with the ability to assess
information carefully and understand its relevance.
 </p5></li>
 <br>

 <li><p5><b>Researching skills: </b>I have experience of and talent for
investigating, analysing
 and rescarching a variety or ditterent processes and offering practical
 improvements and solutions for the benefit of the organisation.</p5></li>

 <h5>Listening Music</h5>
 <div class="pra">
 <p>Making music is far more than just a pleasant pastime.
Simply listening to music can be soothing for the soul, mind and body – an allround mood booster – so imagine what creating music can do to a person. Anyone who
plays music goes on a fulfilling journey of emotion, sound, focus, persistence and
learning.</p>

 <h5>Playing games</h5>
 <div class="pra">
 <p>
 Image result
Gaming is really a workout for your mind disguised as
fun. Studies have shown that playing video games regularly may increase gray matter
in the brain and boost brain connectivity. (Gray matter is associated with muscle
control, memories, perception, and spatial navigation.)For many people, video games
are a legitimate hobby. By sitting down at your computer or picking up a
controller, video games often provide a place to escape the anxieties that real
life throws our way.</p>

 <h5>Reading Books</h5>
 <div class="pra">
 <p>Reading is considered a good hobby because it leads to
the all-round development of your brain and personality. Reading can be done by
anyone, at any age. It has a low barrier for entry as it is inexpensive. Moreover,
reading also has substantial health benefits apart from enabling recreation.</p>
